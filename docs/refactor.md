# 🚀 Codex Optimization Prompt — Meeting Bot (Next.js + Convex + WebRTC + AI)

## 📌 Context

You are working on a **real-time AI-powered meeting platform** built with:

* Next.js 16 (App Router) + React 19
* Convex (database + realtime backend)
* Clerk (authentication + organizations)
* WebRTC (peer-to-peer media)
* Groq APIs (Whisper transcription + LLM summarization)

The system already supports:

* Authentication + org-based tenancy
* Real-time meetings with WebRTC
* Chat, transcripts, summaries, and tasks
* Convex-powered reactive state
* AI summaries with action items
* Basic notifications, insights, and task management

However, this is still a **prototype system** with limitations in:

* Security & authorization
* WebRTC reliability (STUN-only)
* Task workflows
* Integrations (partial)
* Meeting lifecycle rules
* Scalability & performance

---

# 🎯 Objective

Refactor and optimize the current implementation to:

1. Improve **performance and scalability**
2. Enforce **proper architecture and separation of concerns**
3. Harden **security and authorization**
4. Enhance **real-time reliability (WebRTC + Convex)**
5. Extend **product features to production-level**
6. Ensure **all integrations work correctly and are production-ready**

# ⚙️ PART 1 — Code & Architecture Optimization

## 🔹 1. Convex Backend Improvements

### Problems

* Weak authorization checks
* Overloaded mutations
* Missing indexing strategies
* Realtime subscriptions may over-fetch

### Required Improvements

* Implement **strict org-level and meeting-level authorization guards**
* Add **row-level security patterns**
* Split large mutations into:
  * command handlers
  * validation layer
  * domain services
* Introduce **Convex indexes** for:
  * meetings by orgId + status
  * transcripts by meetingId + timestamp
  * messages by meetingId + createdAt
* Implement:

```ts
assertOrgAccess(user, orgId)
assertMeetingAccess(user, meetingId)
```

---

## 🔹 2. WebRTC Optimization

### Problems

* STUN-only → fails behind NAT/firewalls
* Convex used as signaling store → latency risk
* Mesh architecture → not scalable

### Required Improvements

* Add **TURN server support** (e.g., Coturn)
* Implement:
  * fallback ICE configuration
* Optimize signaling:
  * batch ICE candidates
  * reduce DB writes
* Add connection state monitoring:

```ts
pc.onconnectionstatechange
```

* Optional (advanced):
  * introduce **SFU (Selective Forwarding Unit)** architecture

---

## 🔹 3. Transcription Pipeline Optimization

### Problems

* Only local mic transcription
* No speaker separation
* No streaming pipeline

### Required Improvements

* Add:
  * multi-speaker tagging
  * speaker diarization logic (even heuristic)
* Introduce:
  * streaming transcription (WebSocket-based)
* Batch processing optimization:
  * adaptive chunking
  * retry + fallback mechanism

---

## 🔹 4. AI Summarization Improvements

### Problems

* Entire transcript sent → inefficient
* No incremental intelligence

### Required Improvements

* Implement:
  * chunk-based summarization pipeline
  * summary merging strategy
* Add:
  * incremental summary updates
* Cache summaries using:

```ts
summary_chunks
```

---

## 🔹 5. Frontend Optimization (React + Next.js)

### Problems

* Over-reliance on Convex subscriptions
* Possible unnecessary re-renders

### Required Improvements

* Use:
  * React memoization (`useMemo`, `useCallback`)
  * component splitting
* Introduce:
  * suspense boundaries
  * lazy loading for heavy components
* Optimize:
  * participant grid rendering
  * transcript rendering (virtualization)

---

# 🔐 PART 2 — Security Hardening

## Required Fixes

* Enforce:
  * org isolation (strict)
  * meeting access validation
* Validate all:
  * Convex mutations
  * API routes
* Prevent:
  * unauthorized transcript access
  * message injection
* Add:
  * rate limiting for APIs
  * input sanitization
* Secure:
  * Groq API calls (server-only usage)

---

# ⚡ PART 3 — Performance & Scaling

## Required Improvements

* Reduce Convex writes:
  * batch signals
  * batch transcript inserts
* Introduce:
  * caching layer (client + server)
* Optimize:
  * dashboard queries
  * insights queries
* Add:
  * background jobs (cron-like system)
    * scheduled meetings
    * reminders
    * summary generation

---

# 🧩 PART 4 — Feature Enhancements (HIGH VALUE)

## 🔹 1. Meeting System

* Do NOT end meeting when a user leaves
* Add:
  * host role
  * co-host support
* Meeting states:
  * scheduled → active → ended → archived

---

## 🔹 2. Recording System

* Implement:
  * media recording (MediaRecorder API)
  * upload to storage (S3 / Cloudflare R2)
* Store in:

```ts
meeting_assets.type = "recording"
```

* Add playback UI in meeting details

---

## 🔹 3. Task Management (Upgrade to Full System)

Add:

* edit tasks
* mark complete
* assign users
* due dates
* priority levels
* task comments

---

## 🔹 4. Integrations (MAKE THEM REAL)

Implement actual working integrations:

### Google Calendar

* create events
* sync scheduled meetings

### Zoom / Meet

* external meeting links

### Slack

* send:
  * meeting alerts
  * summary messages

---

## 🔹 5. Notifications System Upgrade

* Add:
  * real-time push notifications
  * email notifications
  * reminder system

---

## 🔹 6. Insights & Analytics (AI-powered)

Add:

* speaker talk-time analysis
* sentiment analysis
* keyword extraction
* meeting productivity score

2. Improved WebRTC hook
3. Secure API routes
4. Optimized React components
5. Integration implementations
6. New feature modules (tasks, recordings, analytics)
7. Scalable architecture patterns

---

# ⚠️ Constraints

* Do NOT break existing functionality
* Maintain:
  * Clerk auth integration
  * Convex backend compatibility
  * Next.js App Router structure
* All changes must be:
  * backward compatible
  * production-ready
  * scalable

---

# ✅ Final Goal

Transform this system from a **prototype meeting tool → production-grade AI meeting platform** with:

* strong real-time performance
* secure multi-tenant architecture
* reliable media + AI pipelines
* full collaboration workflows
* working integrations

If you want, I can next:

* convert this into **step-by-step implementation tasks**
* or generate **actual optimized code for Convex/WebRTC parts**
* or design **system architecture v2 diagram (very useful for interviews + projects)**
