# Application Architecture Document

## Overview
This document outlines the architecture, technology stack, and file system structure of the **Meeting Bot** application. The application is a real-time collaborative platform that allows users to create, schedule, and join video meetings directly within the app, transcribe conversations, and manage meeting assets and organizations.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js 16 (App Router) & React 19
- **Backend & Database**: Convex (Serverless functions and real-time database)
- **Authentication**: Clerk (with Convex integration)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4
- **UI Components**: Shadcn UI, Radix UI primitives, Base UI
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Real-time Communication**: Native WebRTC (for peer-to-peer audio/video streaming)

---

## High-Level Architecture Flow
1. **Authentication (Clerk)**: Users authenticate via Clerk. Route protection is handled via Next.js middleware (`proxy.ts`), which ensures unauthorized users cannot access the dashboard or meeting rooms. 
2. **Data Sync (Convex)**: The user and organization data is synchronized between Clerk and the Convex database either via direct mutations from the client or through webhooks.
3. **Dashboard & Organization**: Upon login, users land on the Dashboard where they can manage their organizations, view insights, handle tasks, and see upcoming/past meetings.
4. **Meeting Room & WebRTC**:
   - The user joins a meeting interface (`app/(meeting-room)/meeting/`).
   - A custom WebRTC hook (`hooks/use-webrtc.ts`) manages access to user media (camera/microphone).
   - Peer connections are established directly between participants utilizing Google's STUN servers. Convex acts as the signaling server to exchange ICE candidates and session descriptions real-time.
5. **Real-time Engine**: All chat, live transcripts, notifications, and meeting states are managed by Convex queries and mutations, providing a reactive end-to-end experience.

## Database Schema (Convex)
The application utilizes a strongly-typed schema defined in `convex/schema.ts`.

### 1. `users`
- Stores user data synchronized from Clerk.
- Fields: `clerkId`, `email`, `firstName`, `lastName`, `imageUrl`, `orgIds` (Array of organization IDs).

### 2. `organizations`
- Represents tenant workspaces/organizations.
- Fields: `clerkId`, `name`, `slug`, `imageUrl`.

### 3. `meetings`
- Central entity representing a video conference.
- Fields: 
  - `orgId`, `creatorId`: References to organization and the user who created it.
  - `title`, `purpose`, `description`.
  - `status`: Literal union of `"scheduled" | "active" | "ended"`.
  - `scheduledFor`, `startedAt`, `endedAt`: Timestamps of the meeting lifecycle.

### 4. `transcripts`
- Stores active transcriptions tied to a specific meeting.
- Fields: `meetingId`, `speakerId`, `speakerName`, `text`, `timestamp`.

### 5. `meeting_assets`
- Stores generated assets from a finished meeting.
- Fields: `meetingId`, `type` (`"summary"` | `"recording"`), `content` (Markdown), and an optional `storageId` for larger binary files referencing Convex's generic storage.

### 6. `notifications`
- App-wide user alerts.
- Fields: `userId`, `orgId`, `message`, `link`, `isRead`, `createdAt`.
